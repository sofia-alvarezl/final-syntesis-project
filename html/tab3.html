<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
<div id="analysis2Plot1"></div>
<p id="analysis2Eqn1" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<ul>
  <p>
    <li>Through the graph we can analyze that in my home there are varied movements around electricity, from month one to month two there was an increase since consumption increased, from month two to month three decreased in a notorious way since consumption decreased so there were less expenses, and these movements occurred in the same way in the other months, from month three to month four increased and from month four to month five decreased. </li></p>
<li>When talking about the linear regression line, it can be observed that there is a great variability from one month to the other, the figures, although they do not change with very high percentages, are not constant in relation to electricity consumption. </li>
        
  <li> </h4><p>
  <li>Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX
    syntax in order to compute that.</li>
    <li>
        <p> $$ y=(-1.90)(6)+(141.50)=130.1 $$
    
    
  <li>
    There are several ways to keep constant or reduce electricity consumption , to start you can perform the analysis of the percentages of kwh spent in the months and observe how much variability there is , if there is an increase in households can opt for sustainable solutions such as using efficient appliances , turn off appliances and lights when not in operation, do not leave connected chargers if they are not being used, change for led bulbs , and create an awareness in the inhabitants of the home since it is a task for everyone.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
<div id="analysis2Plot2"></div>
<p id="analysis2Eqn2" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<ul>
  <li>All people are in the same range, but there is an accelerated growth in the graph, since there is one person who has more inhabitants (twice as many) compared to the others.</li>
  <li>The linear regression line may have a small constant versus respondent data as they are under the same or very similar range, only one respondent is very far away.</li>
  <li>
    Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$
    people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.
  </li>
  <p> $$ y=(114.10)(200)+(238.80)=23058.8 $$
  <li>
    There is not enough information to have a prediction since the people surveyed all live with between 3 and 4 residents in their homes, except one who lives with 8 people and there if you can visualize an increase too wide since it went from being between 61 and 248 kwh to 728 kwh, on the other hand it can be seen that sometimes the more people living in the house, the more electricity will be spent, but this varies greatly depending on the household.
  </li>
</ul>
