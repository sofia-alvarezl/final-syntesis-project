<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
<p>
  This second part of the project must be done individual. For each plot, you
  must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your
  information is true.

<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Home there is a constant variation in terms of energy consumption, which although it is not exaggerated if it is noticed, we can see how from month 1 to month 2 there is a decrease, but from month 2 to month 3 and 4 there is an increase in energy expenditure, by month 5 it decreases again.
  </li>
  <li>  The regression line (line with gray dots) is an approximation of actual energy expenditure, which in this graph shows a constant, while the red dots do not have a defined trend, so there is not a completely consistent relationship.</li>
  <li>
    Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX
    syntax in order to compute that.
    <p> $$ y=(0.20)(6)+(106.40)=107.6 $$
  </li>
  <li>
    In my home there is a constant change in terms of energy consumption, from month 1 to month 5 it varies between 95 to 120 khw, depending on the time we are in the house and the use that is given to the different electrical devices.
    We must create awareness about saving energy, and avoiding unnecessary expenses, some tips are: take short showers, use natural light, and disconnect useless devices

    Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$
    people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.
