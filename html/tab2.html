<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
<div id="analysis2Plot1"></div>
<p id="analysis2Eqn1" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Home there is a constant variation in terms of energy consumption, which although it is not exaggerated if it is noticed, we can see how from month 1 to month 2 there is a decrease, but from month 2 to month 3 and 4 there is an increase in energy expenditure, by month 5 it decreases again.
  </li>
  <li>  The regression line (line with gray dots) is an approximation of actual energy expenditure, which in this graph shows a constant, while the red dots do not have a defined trend, so there is not a completely consistent relationship.</li>
  <li>
    Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX
    syntax in order to compute that.
    <p> $$ y=(0.20)(6)+(106.40)=107.6 $$
  </li>
  <li>
    In my home there is a constant change in terms of energy consumption, from month 1 to month 5 it varies between 95 to 120 khw, depending on the time we are in the house and the use that is given to the different electrical devices.
    We must create awareness about saving energy, and avoiding unnecessary expenses, some tips are: take short showers, use natural light, and disconnect useless devices
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
<div id="analysis2Plot2"></div>
<p id="analysis2Eqn2" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Most of the respondents are in the same range in terms of people (3 or 4) and spending (between 94 and 220).  The data that creates a large increase in the regression line is the one that shows a household with 8 people and 728kwh of energy</li>
  <li>  The red dots show the real consumption of each one of the homes while the gray dots show the real average consumption, with this they highlight the great increase that there is from homes of 3 or 4 people to homes of 8 people in terms of energy expenditure.
  </li>
  <li>
    Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$
    people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> $$ y=(114.10)(200)+(238.80)=23058.8 $$
  
      
  <li>
    * Although it is difficult to predict with so little information, the regression line shows a great relationship between people and expenses (the more people in a house, the more energy is used) </br>
    *There are specific points, such as the one who lives with 6 people in his house and only spends 93 KWh per month, this shows that there are other elements that can interfere with spending, possibly in this family there is a great commitment to the environment, so who seek more convenient means.</br>
    * The cost and value of how much money to pay also depends on where each home is located. </br>
  </li>
</ul>
