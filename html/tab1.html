  </p>
  <h2>Is the International System of Units' (SI) standard unit of power (energy per unit time), the equivalent of one jouleper second. </br>

    The watt is used to specify the rate at which electrical energy is dissipated, or the rate at which electromagnetic energy is radiated, absorbed, or dissipated. </br>
    
    Amps (A) x Volts (V) x Power Factor = Watts. </br> </h2>

<h2>
-Producing renewable energy means using the sun, the force of the wind or water and the heat of the earth, present in nature, to generate electricity.  The energy that, compared to that produced by conventional sources, is capable of reducing emission levels. </br>
-Renewable energies are destined to become the most profitable source of electricity for the planet and economic development. </br>
-It is something inexhaustible, respectful of the environment, renewable, constantly evolving, and cheap; its types are: Solar, wind, hydraulic, geothermal, tidal,

<h2>
    Electric energy, also known as electrical energy, is a form of energy that is associated with the flow of electric charge. It is the energy that is transferred through the movement of electrons in a circuit or electrical conductor.</br>

    Electric energy is generated through a variety of methods, including burning fossil fuels, nuclear reactions, hydroelectric power, wind power, and solar power. It is then distributed to homes and businesses through power grids, where it can be used to power appliances, machinery, and other devices.</br>
    
    Electric energy can be measured in a variety of units, including watts (W), kilowatts (kW), and megawatts (MW). The amount of energy consumed by a device or system can also be measured in terms of kilowatt-hours (kWh) or megawatt-hours (MWh).</br>
    
    Electric energy is a versatile form of energy that can be easily converted into other forms of energy, such as mechanical energy, thermal energy, or light energy. It is also a clean form of energy when generated from renewable sources, making it an important component in the transition towards a sustainable energy future.</br>

<h2>
    Linear regression is a statistical method used to analyze the relationship between two variables, where one variable (the independent variable) is used to predict the value of another variable (the dependent variable).</br> 

    In linear regression, the goal is to find a linear relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable. The equation for a linear relationship is typically expressed as:</br>
    
    y = mx + b </br>
    
    where: </br>
    - y is the dependent variable </br>
    - x is the independent variable </br>
    - m is the slope of the line, which represents the change in y for each unit change in x </br>
    - b is the y-intercept, which represents the value of y when x is equal to zero. </br>
    
    The process of linear regression involves finding the values of m and b that best fit the data. This is typically done by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the predicted values of y (based on the linear equation) and the actual values of y in the dataset. This method is called the least squares method. </br>
