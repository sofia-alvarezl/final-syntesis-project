    <h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>

    <div id="analysis3Plot1"></div>
    <p id="analysis3Eqn1" style="text-align: center"></p>
    <h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
      <ul>
            <li>
            <p>• There is a decrease in the regression line in reference to the months between December and April, that is, the highest consumption occurred in the month of December (month #1) and it was decreasing moderately </p> </li>
            <li>
            <p>• In general, the consumption from month to month has been similar, with an average of 759 kWh; except for the month of February (month #3) where 594 kwh were. </p> </li>
            <li>Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX
                syntax in order to compute that.</li>
            <li>
            <p> $$ y=(-39.60)(6)+(844.80)=607.2 $$
        
            <li>
            <p>• In conclusion, the best way to reduce or keep electricity consumption stable is to adapt economizing habits, and to become aware that this resource is vital for human beings and that it generates environmental repercussions that may affect us in the future.</li></p>
      </ul>
    <h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
    <div id="analysis3Plot2"></div>
    <p id="eanalysis3Eqn2" style="text-align: center"></p>
    <h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
    <p>According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic displays that behavior in terms of:
    </p>
    <ul>
         <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
         <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
         <li>Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$ people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.</li>
         <li>
            <p> $$ y=(-39.60)(200)+(844.80)=607.2 $$
        
            <li>
         <li>A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation between these two variables.</li>
      </ul>
