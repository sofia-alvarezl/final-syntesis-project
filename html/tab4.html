    <h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>

    <div id="analysis3Plot1"></div>
    <p id="analysis3Eqn1" style="text-align: center"></p>
    <h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
      <ul>
            <li>
            <p>• There is a decrease in the regression line in reference to the months between December and April, that is, the highest consumption occurred in the month of December (month #1) and it was decreasing moderately </p> </li>
            <li>
            <p>• In general, the consumption from month to month has been similar, with an average of 759 kWh; except for the month of February (month #3) where 594 kwh were. </p> </li>
            <li>Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX
                syntax in order to compute that.</li>
            <li>
            <p> $$ y=(-39.60)(6)+(844.80)=607.2 $$
        
            <li>
            <p>• In conclusion, the best way to reduce or keep electricity consumption stable is to adapt economizing habits, and to become aware that this resource is vital for human beings and that it generates environmental repercussions that may affect us in the future.</li></p>
      </ul>
    <h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
    <div id="analysis3Plot2"></div>
    <p id="analysis3Eqn2" style="text-align: center"></p>
    <h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
    <ul>
         <li>There is very little data, however, the trend indicates that the kWh consumed increases according to the number of residents, even so the kWh spent are not 100% tied to the number of residents since the consumption data is more in the hands of the customs of each home

        </li>
         <li>According to the graph, the Regression line is ascending, however, the variables do not completely depend on the number of residents in the houses, but rather on the habits that families have, in consideration of caring for the environment.
        </li>
         <li>Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$ people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.</li>
         <li>
            <p> $$ y=(24.27)(200)+(54.77)=4908.77 $$
        
            
         <li>In conclusion these two variables, despite the fact that they are usually accompanied by each other, that is to say that their increase or decrease becomes proportional; in the graph the points of real consumption are dispersed (Ex: there can be 6 residents and a low expense, while there can be 3 residents and a slightly higher kwh expense); so it can be concluded that this depends on family practices</li>
      </ul>
