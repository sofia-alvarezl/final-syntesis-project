<h3>Watt (physical unit)</h3>
  </p>Is the International System of Units' (SI) standard unit of power (energy per unit time), the equivalent of one jouleper second. </br>

    The watt is used to specify the rate at which electrical energy isdissipated, or the rate at which electromagnetic energy is radiated, absorbed, or dissipated. </br>
    
    Amps (A) x Volts (V) x Power Factor = Watts. </br>

<h3>Renewable energy</h3>
</p>Producing renewable energy means using the sun, the force of the wind or water and the heat of the earth, present in nature, to generate electricity.  The energy that, compared to that produced by conventional sources, is capable of reducing emission levels. </br>
Renewable energies are destined to become the most profitable source of electricity for the planet and economic development. </br>
It is something inexhaustible, respectful of the environment, renewable, constantly evolving, and cheap; its types are: Solar, wind, hydraulic, geothermal, tidal,
